title: "Dear Apple, AI is not missing piece in your puzzle"
---


I recently bought an 11" iPad Air M2 model, after using it just for a week I decided to return it. I just couldn't
justify the price for use case.
Not that my use case is too much for a tabled, but specifically for iPad. But other than drawing on it and browsing the
web, I couldn't find any other use case that I use for my daily drive
I mean it's great, it's very fast, the display is amazing, especially with new Apple Pencil Pro, I love how it feels
when I draw on it,
but there is one thing that really bothers me, it's not the hardware - in fact I think iPad is already exceeded its
limit in terms of hardware -
it's how Apple is trying hard to limit its iPad line on OS level.

Imagine a very powerful machine, with M2 chip, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, but you can't even install any desktop app
on it.
iPadOS is a protection line for Apple to keep its Mac line alive. Okay I get it, greed over everything. But then what
makes iPad so special, when I can do
most stuff on my Macbook Air?
Apple could make iPad, so that it runs MacOS and iPadOS depending on how you use it. For instance, you attached Magic
Keyboard, it boots MacOS and vice versa. But no, for them profit is more important than user experience.

I don't get the point of having an M4 chip in iPad Pro, if an average user will only use half of its power. M1 is
already an overkill for iPad.
But Apple is marketing it as "must-have" feature.

Okay, let's return back to AI. After watching WWDC 2024 opening keynote yesterday, I realized that Apple is out of new
ideas already. I mean I get it
Apple don't want to be the first, they want to be the best in what they create. But AI? Not even close to this
principle. Okay, I kinda understand, they
don't want to miss the train. Investors are craving for it, because it's the hottest thing right now. And we the people
until AI didn't know how to live
properly. But somehow trillion-dollar company decides to follow the trend. And they are not even good at it. As a
consumer I have to own at least iPhone 15 Pro.
I don't know minimum requirements for Apple Intelligence, but I hardly believe that hardware is the only reason for this
decision. I doubt, iPhone 16
will be able to support AI. We will see.
Since when AI became a privilege? Or why do they think that people need to generate phony images with AI? Like we are
not already fed up with fake images on social media?
And people at Apple think that people will prefer more expensive devices just because of AI?
I am seriously tired of seeing "AI" every day in every corner of my life.
Especially when they announced that they will partner with OpenAI to bring AI to their devices. Again "Privacy" is their
killer selling point. People at Apple smart enough to create such an amazing
ecosystem, but not smart enough to have decent AI?

Speaking of Privacy, Apple claims AI will be on-device, so that your data will be safe. Until it doesn't... When it's
too complex to run on-device, it will be
computed on Apple's servers named ["Private Cloud Compute"](https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/).
This is joke right? How is that different from say from OpenAI's servers? Oh yes, my bad, it uses custom designed
Apple Silicon. So it should be safe. People at Apple probably think that we are too stupid, what privacy has got to do
processor architecture? Apple Silicon is safer
than Intel's? If so, how come? Apple is not a security company. Hope we don't have to remind them
about [iCloud hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_nude_photo_leak).

Then they showed how they are getting more serious about gaming with 14 video games. Yes 14. Fourteen! And since Apple
sponsor them, they can be bought only on Apple Store.
Seriously Apple? "Bioshock" from my Steam library is playable, whereas "Resident Evil Village" not in spite of being in
my Steam library since you are sponsoring them? This is what you think about gaming on Mac? With just a few games
only available in Apple Store? And you think people will buy Mac for gaming?

And their another killer app was "Calculator". Come on Apple, you waited 15 years to bring a stock calculator app to
iPad? And you think because of that
people will buy iPad? A device that's bigger than any calculator? Will it make iPad more loveable? I don't think so.

I could never imagine one day a company like OpenAI will save Apple's AI assistant Siri from being a totally useless
service.

Dear Apple, please stop pushing AI to every corner of your ecosystem. We - the consumers don't need this kind of trendy
feature. We need to utilize the power of our devices.
