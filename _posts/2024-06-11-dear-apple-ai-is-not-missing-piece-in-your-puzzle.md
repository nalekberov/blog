title: "Dear Apple, AI is not missing piece in your puzzle"
---


I recently bought an 11" iPad Air M2 model, after using it just for a week I decided to return it.
I mean it's great, it's very fast, the display is amazing, especially with new Apple Pencil Pro, I love how it feels when I draw on it, 
but there is one thing that really bothers me - it's not the hardware - in fact I think Ipad is already exceeded its limit in terms of hardware -
it's how Apple is trying hard to limit its Ipad line on OS level.

Imagine a very powerful machine, with M2 chip, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, but you can't even install any desktop app on it.
Ipad OS is a protection line for Apple to keep its Mac line alive. Okay I get it, greed over everything. But then what makes Ipad so special, when I can do
most stuff on my Macbook Air?
Apple could make Ipad, so that it runs MacOS and Ipad OS depending on how you use it. For instance, you attached Magic Keyboard, it boots MacOS and vice versa. But no, for them profit is more important than user experience.

I don't get the point of having an M4 chip in Ipad Pro, if an average user will only use half of its power. M1 is already an overkill for Ipad.
But Apple is marketing it as "must-have" feature.

Okay, let's return back to AI. After watching WWDC 2024 opening keynote yesterday, I realized that Apple is out of new ideas already. I mean I get it
Apple don't want to be the first, they want to be the best in what they create. But AI? Not even close to this principle. Especially when they announced that
they will partner with OpenAI to bring AI to their devices. Again "Privacy" is their killer selling point. People at Apple smart enough to create such an amazing
ecosystem, but not smart enough to have decent AI?

And their another killer app was "Calculator". Come on Apple, you waited 15 years to bring a stock calculator app to Ipad? And you think because of that
people will buy Ipad? A device that's bigger than any calculator? Will it make Ipad more loveable? I don't think so.

I could never imagine one day a company like OpenAI will save Apple's AI assistant Siri from being a totally useless service.

Dear Apple, please stop pushing AI to every corner of your ecosystem. We - the consumers don't need this kind of trendy feature. We need to utilize the power of our devices.
