title: "Dear Apple, AI is not missing piece in your puzzle"
---


I recently bought an 11" iPad Air M2 model, after using it just for a week I decided to return it. I just couldn't
justify the price for the use case.
Not that my use case is too much for a tablet, but specifically for iPad, other than drawing on it and browsing the
web, I couldn't find any other use case that I apply for my daily drive. The device itself with 128GB memory costs ~700
Euros.
Without a keyboard iPad is just a gaming and drawing, and a little bit of reader device. So in order to be able to write
long texts
on it, I had to buy a Magic Keyboard.
Which is another ~400 Euros.
So, I had to pay ~1100 Euros for a device which is tightly coupled into Apple's ecosystem.
So, this device is designed around iCloud and App Store. Since it's very closed I have the least control over it.
In order to use the device you first have to log in to your iCloud account.
I mean it's great toy, it's extremely fast, the display is amazing, especially with new Apple Pencil Pro, I love how it
feels when I draw on it, but there is one thing that really bothers me, it's not the hardware - in fact I think iPad is already exceeded its
limit in terms of hardware - it's how Apple is trying hard to limit its iPad line on OS level.
I felt just like a guest on iPad, not the owner.
Since I knew from my experience how Apple is able to make its devices slower and more power hungry with every OS update,
I felt less welcome. If I pay 1100 Euros for a device, I expect to have some kind of control over it, 
not an international multi-billionaire company.

Imagine a very powerful machine, with M2 chip, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, but you can't even install any desktop app
on it.
We can safely assume that iPadOS is a protection line for Apple to keep its Mac line alive. Okay I get it, greed over everything. But then what
makes iPad so special, when I can do most stuff on my Macbook Air?
Apple could make iPad, so that it runs MacOS and iPadOS depending on how you use it. For instance, you attached Magic
Keyboard, it boots MacOS and vice versa. But no, for them profit is more important than user experience.
I don't get the point of having an M4 chip in iPad Pro, if an average user will only use half of its power. M1 is
already an overkill for iPad.
But Apple is marketing every new M chip as if it makes your iPad more useful. In essence, they just get more expensive
and excessively more powerful.

Okay, let's return back to AI. Excuse me, "Apple Intelligence".
After watching WWDC 2024 opening keynote yesterday, I realized that Apple is already running out of new
ideas.
Apple love to pretend that they are always creating new category, as if
they are not actually
competing with other companies. This was especially seen and was ridiculous in the context of AI.
It's simply AI dear Apple - however you want to call it - you didn't reinvent anything here.
I mean, I get it
Apple don't want to be the first, they want to be the best in what they create. But AI? Not even close to this
principle. It's also understandable, they
don't want to miss the train. Investors are craving for it, because it's the hottest thing right now. And we the people
until AI didn't know how to live
properly. And somehow trillion-dollar company decides to follow the trend. And they are not even good at it. As a
consumer I have to own at least iPhone 15 Pro. This is hilarious.
I don't know the minimum hardware requirements for Apple Intelligence, but I hardly believe that hardware here is the reason
for this decision. But I am not expert in this area. I can't really judge. However, I don't believe that, iPhone 16 (make no
mistake, without Pro, Max) will support AI. We will see.

Here is an honest question: since when AI became a privilege? Or why do management at Apple think that people need to
generate phony images on their devices? Like we are
not already fed up with fake images popping up here and there?
And people at Apple think that people will prefer more expensive devices just because of AI?
I am seriously tired of seeing "AI" every day in every corner of my life.
Especially when they announced that they will partner with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to their devices. Again "Privacy" is their
killer selling point.

Speaking of Privacy, Apple claims AI will be on-device, so that your data will be safe. Until it doesn't... When it's
too complex to run on-device, it will be
computed on Apple's servers named ["Private Cloud Compute"](https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/).
This is joke right? How is that different from say from OpenAI's servers? Oh yes, my bad, it uses custom designed
Apple Silicon. So it should be safe. People at Apple probably think that we are too stupid, what privacy has got to do
processor architecture? Apple Silicon is safer
than Intel's? If so, how come? Apple is not a security company. Hope we don't have to remind them
about [iCloud hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_nude_photo_leak).

Then they showed how they are getting more serious about gaming with 14 video games. Yes 14. FOURTEEN Titles! And since
Apple
sponsor them, they can be bought only on Apple Store.
Seriously Apple? "Bioshock" from my Steam library is playable, whereas "Resident Evil Village" not, in spite of being in
my Steam library - since you are sponsoring them? This is what you think about gaming on Mac? With just a few games
only available through App Store? And you think people will buy Mac for gaming?

Okay, it didn't end there, they announced one more another killer thing. Guess what? A "Calculator" app on iPad.
Come on Apple, you waited 14 years to bring a stock calculator app to iPad? And you think because of that
people will buy iPad more? A device that's bigger than any calculator? Will it make iPad more loveable? I don't think
so.

Additionally, Apple I didn't hear anything how Apple will ensure its users' privacy while interacting with ChatGPT.
I hope they are not passing any traceable data to OpenAI. Unfortunately I couldn't find any documentation about it so
far.

I could never imagine one day a company like OpenAI will save Apple's AI assistant Siri from being a nearly useless
service. People at Apple smart enough to create such an amazing
ecosystem, but not smart enough to have decent AI? I don't think so, they are smart enough to understand that AI bubble
will burst one day. Why would they invest so much in it?

Dear Apple, please stop pushing AI to every corner of your ecosystem. We - the consumers don't need this kind of trendy
feature. We need to utilize the power of our devices.
