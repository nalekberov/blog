title: "Some life hacks I acquired recently"
---

I use Apple's amazing Mac line for everyday stuff - from programming to browsing web. I love the way Apple put its
engineering efforts to make their machines to work as snappy as possible. Booting up OS only takes 10 seconds or so.
Best part is unlike Microsoft, Apple has got a taste. They what they are doing. Okay enough fanboy stuff.

Here are some tools I use for my daily drive:

### Spotlight

I love spotlight, I use it mostly to switch between apps, say you wanna switch to Safari to see changes you made in
Webstorm?
Cmd + Space, type "Saf" + Enter. Boom, you are right in the browser. You might ask - but what about Cmd + Tab? Isn't it
faster? yes, in ideal case you would have to press two keys. I find Spotlight way faster -
it guarantees constant key travel, whereas depending on how much app you have currently opened, you would have to press
many times "Tab" key while holding "Cmd" key with Cmd + Tab combination. And yes, plus more eye movement.

### MonitorControl

If there is one application I install right after installing the OS, it's this app, I slightly dim the brightness of my
display during evening time, otherwise my eyes hurt. Not only it's able to control the brightness, it can additionally
control audio level, if your display have one. The best part is, it's free and open-source and actively maintained at
the
time of writing this blog post.

### Little Snitch

I am very paranoid when it comes to privacy, I have zero trust to any software in that regard. Luckily I don't have to
worry with Little Snitch. It gives me ability to monitor and control my network activity, specifically which application
communicates with which domain/IP. Then I am able to block sneaky ones.

### Obsidian

Fun fact: I wrote this blog post in Obsidian. If there is one solution to my note-taking needs and habits, it's
Obsidian! It's easy to learn, free to use for personal usage. It's so fast despite being built on Electron. I store my
vault in my iCloud drive, so every change I make in one machine immediately synced across all my devices. I additionally 
examined their network activity, haven't caught anything suspicious so far. The team deserves a big “Thank You”!

### Superkey

This one I actually discovered just couple of days ago. It's still under trial for me. However, I can say it's very amazing
for people like me - who loves controlling without mouse. It gives you ability to focus on a text and click on it by
clicking on "Enter" key
