title:  "My short Munich trip"
---

I have recently been to Munich. Purpose of the visit was on-site interview. Actually the flight was not as expected, trip was awesome, but there was about ~10 hours of flight delay. I stayed in Moscow in the airport overnight. I was supposed to be in Munich at on 26th October at ~11.00 pm . I landed in Munich at ~09.00 pm on 27th October. With about 3 hours of night sleep I went to the interview.

The company, who invited me to Munich for on-site interview was [Internations](https://www.internations.org). Everyone at this company are really very friendly. They covered my flight and accommodation expenses. The interview process was exciting. CTO of the company Lars Strojny welcomed me warmly.

Interview process was consisted of two main topics:

REST API design
Database design
I will admit: During the interview process I learned new things, like when to use HTTP HEAD method, what is safe request, what is [idempotency](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215112435/http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/idempotency.html), what is Hypermedia, use case of HAL and JSON-LD.

I didn't get job offer. But the trip was very exciting. Munich is really fantastic city. With parks, historical buildings, nice street arts the city is beautiful. I took some [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nurlan-alekberov/albums/72157662408498128).
