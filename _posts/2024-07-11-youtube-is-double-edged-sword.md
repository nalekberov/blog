title: "Youtube is double-edged sword"
---


So it's around 9pm, I decided to hit youtube.com on my browser's address bar, voila! my feed is full of
just-what-I-wanted right now - a random dude sharing his opinion about another youtuber who taught herself to speak in
several languages, and she is now just 18 years old. What can be better discovery for person like me who struggles to
learn german for years? That's fantastic! "Thank you Youtube algorithm" I say to myself and go ahead to visit some more
videos with the hope to get some "snakeoil" solution to my german problem. Now, this is great, what a great time to be
alive, you can get some invaluable tips from people around the world. Especially from those, who are really knowledgable
in what they are talking about.

This are all good sides of the algorithm, enter the dark side of the algorithm. Now, let's say now you search youtube
for some physical or mental diseases. And next day youtube will bombard you with all so called "experts" who has opinion
about everything, and very proficient at selling their "snakeoil" even to those who doesn't seem to have serious
problems. There are this kind of people everywhere and unfortunately Youtube is no exception here. In the beginning all
those videos seem just naive educational videos, the more you advance in watching their videos, the more you tend to
wear rose-colored glasses until you realize that this person is not a charity, they have to make money, no one just
create video to help other people. There are some people who love to help, I don't exclude them. I am talking about the
videos with clickbait titles. What's bizarre about these videos is that, they all seem to help you until you realize
that you just waster your hours to just listen to random people's opinion about things, which they acquired through
their experience in life. This is the evil side of the algorithm, it doesn't care about the quality, all it cares is to
keep your attention in the platform. Because this is who Youtube makes money. The more you watch, the more they show
your ads and potentially one day make you buy premium subscription.

No commercial tool is entirely evil, but greed makes corporations to include evil elements in their products. Youtube is
great place to learn new things, moderation is the key.
